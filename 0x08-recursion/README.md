# 0x08 C - Recursion

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to recursion, as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, you will find a collection of C files that implement various functions and programs using recursion. These files serve as solutions to different coding challenges and exercises, helping you practice and improve your skills in recursive programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, each representing a specific task or concept. Here's an overview of the directories and their contents:

1. **0-puts_recursion.c** - A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
2. **1-print_rev_recursion.c** - A function that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.
3. **2-strlen_recursion.c** - A function that returns the length of a string, using recursion.
4. **3-factorial.c** - A function that returns the factorial of a given number, using recursion.
5. **4-pow_recursion.c** - A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, using recursion.
6. **5-sqrt_recursion.c** - A function that returns the natural square root of a number, using recursion.
7. **6-is_prime_number.c** - A function that checks if a number is a prime number, using recursion.
8. **7-is_palindrome.c** - A function that checks if a string is a palindrome, using recursion.
9. **100-wildcmp.c** - A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0. It can also compare strings containing the special character '*', which can replace any string (including an empty string).

## Requirements

To compile and run the C files in this project, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine, such as `gcc`.
