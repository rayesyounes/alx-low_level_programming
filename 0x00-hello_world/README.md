# 0x00 C - Hello World

This is the first project in the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum, introducing students to the basics of the C programming language and compiling code.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, students should be able to:

* Explain why C programming is awesome
* Understand the structure of a C program and the basic syntax of the language
* Write simple C programs using basic types, operators, and control structures
* Compile and run C programs
* Use common C library functions such as `printf`

## Requirements

* All programs and functions must be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`.
* Code must follow the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) coding style.

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

### 0. Preprocessor

Create a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. 

### 1. Compiler

Write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

### 2. Assembler

Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

### 3. Name

Write a C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

### 4. Hello, puts

Write a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `puts`.

### 5. Hello, printf

Write a C program that prints exactly `"with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line using the function `printf`.

### 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation

Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

### 7. What happens when you type `gcc main.c`

Write a blog post that explains all the steps involved from typing `gcc main.c` to executing the program.
