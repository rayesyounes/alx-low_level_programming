## Introduction

Debugging is an essential skill for low-level programmers as it helps identify and resolve issues in code written in low-level languages such as C. This repository aims to provide a solid foundation in debugging principles and techniques specific to low-level programming. It covers various aspects of debugging in the low-level context, including strategies, tools, and best practices.

## Debugging Techniques

In this section, you will find detailed explanations and examples of common debugging techniques specific to low-level programming. Each technique focuses on a specific aspect of debugging low-level code and provides insights into how to approach and solve problems effectively.

Some of the techniques covered in this repository include:

- **Memory Debugging**: Learn how to identify and fix memory-related issues such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, and null pointer dereferences.
- **Assembly-level Debugging**: Explore the process of debugging low-level code at the assembly language level, understanding registers, and analyzing assembly instructions.
- **Debugging Segmentation Faults**: Understand how to diagnose and resolve segmentation faults, a common issue in low-level programming.
- **Debugging with Core Dumps**: Discover how to analyze core dump files to gain insights into the state of a crashed program.

## Common Debugging Tools

This section highlights some commonly used debugging tools specifically designed for low-level programming. These tools can aid in the process of identifying and resolving issues in low-level code. It covers both command-line tools and integrated development environment (IDE) features that can enhance your low-level debugging workflow.

A few examples of tools covered in this repository are:

- **GDB**: The GNU Debugger is a powerful command-line tool for debugging low-level code, allowing you to inspect registers, memory, and step through assembly instructions.
- **Valgrind**: Learn how to use Valgrind, a suite of tools for memory debugging, leak detection, and profiling in low-level programs.
- **AddressSanitizer**: Explore the AddressSanitizer tool, which helps detect memory errors such as buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, and heap corruption issues.
- **Objdump**: Discover how to use the Objdump tool to disassemble binary files and gain insights into the generated machine code.

## Debugging Strategies

This section provides guidance on developing effective debugging strategies specific to low-level programming. It covers general tips and best practices to help you approach low-level debugging in a systematic and efficient manner. By following these strategies, you can improve your low-level debugging skills and become more proficient at resolving code issues.

Some of the strategies covered in this repository include:

- **Understanding Compiler Optimizations**: Learn how to navigate compiler optimizations and debug optimized low-level code effectively.
- **Debugging with Minimal Code**: Understand the importance of creating minimal reproducible examples to isolate and debug issues in low-level code.
- **Using Debugging Macros**: Discover how to define and use custom debugging macros to assist in low-level debugging efforts.
- **Analyzing Stack and Heap**: Explore techniques for analyzing the stack and heap in low-level programs to identify potential issues.
