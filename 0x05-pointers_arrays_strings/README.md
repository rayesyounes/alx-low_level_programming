# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings, as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, you will find a collection of C files that implement various functions and programs using pointers, arrays, and strings. These files serve as solutions to different coding challenges and exercises, helping you practice and improve your skills in manipulating these fundamental data structures.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, each representing a specific task or concept. Here's an overview of the directories and their contents:

1. **0-reset_to_98.c** - A function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
2. **1-swap.c** - A function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. **2-strlen.c** - A function that returns the length of a string.
4. **3-puts.c** - A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to the standard output.
5. **4-print_rev.c** - A function that prints a string in reverse.
6. **5-rev_string.c** - A function that reverses a string.
7. **6-puts2.c** - A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
8. **7-puts_half.c** - A function that prints the second half of a string.
9. **8-print_array.c** - A function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
10. **9-strcpy.c** - A function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.
11. **100-atoi.c** - A function that converts a string to an integer.
12. **101-keygen.c** - A program that generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C files in this project, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine, such as `gcc`.
