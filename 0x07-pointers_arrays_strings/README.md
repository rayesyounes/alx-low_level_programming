# 0x07. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings, as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, you will find a collection of C files that implement various functions and programs using pointers, arrays, and strings. These files serve as solutions to different coding challenges and exercises, helping you practice and improve your skills in manipulating these fundamental data structures.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, each representing a specific task or concept. Here's an overview of the directories and their contents:

1. **0-memset.c** - A function that fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with a constant byte.
2. **1-memcpy.c** - A function that copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.
3. **2-strchr.c** - A function that locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.
4. **3-strspn.c** - A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
5. **4-strpbrk.c** - A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
6. **5-strstr.c** - A function that locates a substring in a string.
7. **7-print_chessboard.c** - A function that prints the chessboard.
8. **8-print_diagsums.c** - A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
9. **9-set_string.c** - A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
10. **101-crackme_password** - A password-protected program that can be unlocked by finding the correct password.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C files in this project, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine, such as `gcc`.
