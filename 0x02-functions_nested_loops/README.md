# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This project builds on the concepts introduced in the previous projects, introducing students to functions and nested loops in C.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, students should be able to:

* Write functions to modularize code
* Understand the scope of a variable
* Use nested loops to perform repetitive tasks
* Use the `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops for repetitive tasks
* Understand the difference between a declaration and a definition
* Understand the purpose of a function prototype
* Understand the variable argument list (`stdarg`) and how to use it in functions

## Requirements

* All programs and functions must be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`.
* Code must follow the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) coding style.

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

### 0. _putchar

Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 2. 10 x alphabet

Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 3. islower

Write a function that checks for lowercase characters.

### 4. isalpha

Write a function that checks for alphabetic characters.

### 5. Sign

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

### 6. There is no such thing as absolute freedom. When you get too much freedom, you become destroyed

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

### 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

### 9. Learn your times table

Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

### 10. a + b

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. Holberton School, 98 Battery Street, the OG

Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.

### 12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself

Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

### 13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women

Write a function that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.

### 14. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.

### 15. Even Liber Abbaci

Write a program that finds and prints the first `98` Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line.
