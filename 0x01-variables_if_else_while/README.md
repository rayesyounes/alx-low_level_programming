# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project builds on the concepts introduced in the previous project, introducing students to variables, control structures (if/else statements and loops), and basic arithmetic operations in C.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, students should be able to:

* Declare and assign values to variables of different types
* Use arithmetic operators to perform basic mathematical operations
* Use relational operators to compare values
* Use logical operators to combine relational expressions
* Write if/else statements to execute code conditionally
* Use while loops to repeat code until a condition is met
* Understand the scope of a variable
* Use the `for` loop for repetitive tasks

## Requirements

* All programs and functions must be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`.
* Code must follow the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) coding style.

## Tasks

The project includes the following tasks:

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

Write a C program that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit

Write a C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and whether it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 3. alphABET

Write a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except for the letters `q` and `e`.

### 5. Numbers

Write a C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

### 6. Numberz

Write a C program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function and without using a variable of type `char`.

### 7. Smile in the mirror

Write a C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

### 8. Hexadecimal

Write a C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

Write a C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

### 10. 00...99

Write a C program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99.

### 11. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

Write a C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
