# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to more functions and nested loops, as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, you will find a collection of C files that implement various functions and programs using nested loops and additional functions. These files serve as solutions to different coding challenges and exercises, helping you practice and improve your skills in low-level programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, each representing a specific task or concept. Here's an overview of the directories and their contents:

1. **0-isupper.c** - A function that checks for uppercase characters.
2. **1-isdigit.c** - A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
3. **2-mul.c** - A function that multiplies two integers.
4. **3-print_numbers.c** - A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
5. **4-print_most_numbers.c** - A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
6. **5-more_numbers.c** - A function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.
7. **6-print_line.c** - A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
8. **7-print_diagonal.c** - A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
9. **8-print_square.c** - A function that prints a square using the '#' character.
10. **9-fizz_buzz.c** - A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
11. **10-print_triangle.c** - A function that prints a triangle using the '#' character.
12. **100-prime_factor.c** - A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.
13. **101-print_number.c** - A function that prints an integer.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C files in this project, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine, such as `gcc`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
```

3. Compile the C file you want to run. For example, to compile `0-isupper.c`, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-isupper.c -o isupper
```

4. Execute the compiled file. Continuing with the previous example:

```bash
./isupper
```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions or check the program's output to see the results.
