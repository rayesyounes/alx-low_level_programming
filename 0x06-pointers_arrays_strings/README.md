# 0x06. - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings, as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Description

In this project, you will find a collection of C files that implement various functions and programs using pointers, arrays, and strings. These files serve as solutions to different coding challenges and exercises, helping you practice and improve your skills in manipulating these fundamental data structures.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different directories, each representing a specific task or concept. Here's an overview of the directories and their contents:

1. **0-strcat.c** - A function that concatenates two strings.
2. **1-strncat.c** - A function that concatenates two strings, but limits the number of bytes from the source.
3. **2-strncpy.c** - A function that copies a string, but limits the number of bytes from the source.
4. **3-strcmp.c** - A function that compares two strings.
5. **4-rev_array.c** - A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. **5-string_toupper.c** - A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. **6-cap_string.c** - A function that capitalizes all words of a string.
8. **7-leet.c** - A function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) language.
9. **8-rot13.c** - A function that encodes a string using the rot13 cipher.
10. **100-print_number.c** - A function that prints an integer, without using the standard library functions `printf`, `puts`, or `strlen`.
11. **101-magic.c** - A program that prints a[2] = 98, using pointer manipulation.

## Requirements

To compile and run the C files in this project, make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine, such as `gcc`.
